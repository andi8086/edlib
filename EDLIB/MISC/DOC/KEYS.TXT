³       F1              Play normally from StartPoint (SP) position.

                        This key does not scroll the  music, useful when
                        editing the music while it is playing.


        F2              Stop all music activity.

                        You can also use the ESCAPE key. If you're using
                        a MIDI keyboard, you can also cut hanging voices
                        with this key.


        F3              FollowPlay from StartPoint position.

                        The music scrolls as the music plays to show the
                        current position being played. Use the CTRL keys
                        as a fast forward function in this mode.


        F4              Set new StartPoint position (SP).

                        You can set the new position anywhere, no matter
                        if you're halfway through a sequence or not. The
                        hexadecimal stepcounter to the  left of the main
                        editing area will turn dark blue below the point
                        and light blue after it.


        F5              Copy any sequence into the current sequence.

                        Use this key to overwrite the  sequence you  are
                        currently editing, with the contents of another.


        F6              Decrease the tune speed.

                        Hold CTRL to specifically define it.


        F7              Increase the tune speed.

                        Hold CTRL to specifically define it. The Spd box
                        in the bottom right corner of the screen informs
                        you of the current value.


        F8              Define new SuperInsert size.


        F9              Execute the SuperInsert in a sequence.

                        When pressing this key you  will insert  as many
                        events into the sequence as defined  with the F8
                        key. The SpI counter  in the bottom right corner
                        of the  screen informs you of the current value.
                        Note that you can have no  more than 5Fh  events
                        in a single sequence. If you want more than this
                        you have to split it up into two sequences.


        F10             Goto any stepcounter line.

                        The hexadecimal stepcounter is the column to the
                        far left of the editing area.


        F11             Define new RhythmJump value.

                        Sets the number of events the cursor jumps after
                        pressing a note key in the sequence. The RtJ box
                        in the bottom right corner of the screen informs
                        you of the current value.


        F12             Load music in EDL format.

                        Brings up a  file requester  from which  you can
                        choose an EDL file to load. You can also use the
                        Ctrl-F3 key.


        Shift F1        Clear all tracks and sequences.

                        Leaves the instruments and SpFX tables intact. A
                        useful function when  borrowing instruments from
                        another song.


        Shift F2        Clear instruments and SpFX tables.

                        Leaves the tracks and sequences intact. May come
                        in handy if you disliked all the instruments and
                        want to start all over defining them again.


        Shift F5        Copy any sequence into another sequence.

                        As the F5 key, only it takes both a source and a
                        destination input.


        Shift F12       Save music in EDL format.

                        Brings up a  file requester  from which  you can
                        save your song. You can also use the Ctrl-F4 key
                        instead.


        Ctrl F1         Decrease the IRQ timer speed.

        Ctrl F2         Increase the IRQ timer speed.

                        The above keys changes the timer interrupt speed
                        of the song. Be careful when using these! Better
                        have a talk with the programmer using your music
                        to make sure he accepts the  new value. Normally
                        they are set to 46h (70) which matches the speed
                        of the screen  update in 320x200 mode. This way,
                        the music can be  used in a vertical retrace. In
                        some situations you can make use of a fast timer
                        interrupt to speed up the arpeggio in an instru-
                        ment. If you only want to change  the speed of a
                        song, use the F6/F7 keys instead. The Irq box in
                        the bottom right corner of the screen keeps hold
                        of the current timer interrupt speed.


        Ctrl F3         Load music in EDL format.

                        You can also use the F12 key.


        Ctrl F4         Save music in EDL format.

                        You can also use the Shift-F12 key.


        Ctrl F5         Convert the music to D00 format and save it.

                        This brings up a requester asking for a filename
                        of the packed tune. After typing this, the music
                        will be  packed and saved as a  D00 file - to be
                        used in your own programs. The packed tune can't
                        be loaded into the editor again, so  be sure you
                        save your source with Shift-F12 or Ctrl-F4! Note
                        that the  packer goes into  a 9-PASS process. It
                        has been tested intensively with  no problems so
                        far - however, should the packer ever lock up at
                        any time, please  note the pass  number and mail
                        me this number. My  address can be  found in the
                        end of this file. Thank you!


        Ctrl F6         Define new tune speed.

                        Input the speed. Use F6/F7 to decrease/increase.


        Ctrl F7         Define new tune speed.

                        Input the speed. Use F6/F7 to decrease/increase.


        Ctrl F9         Input music name in top of screen.

                        The input takes 20 characters as the name of the
                        music. Remember to do this  before saving a tune
                        to disk or  packing it! D00-files also  contains
                        this string.


        Ctrl F10        Input composer name in top of screen.

                        Again takes 20 characters.  Remember to press it
                        before saving or packing the tune! The D00-files
                        also contains this string.


        M               Enter instrument table.

                        Will enter the instrument table at  the position
                        you left it at last time. If the table window is
                        not active, it will be made active first.


        K               Enter SpFX table.

                        Will enter the table at the position you left it
                        at last time. If the table window is not active,
                        it will be made active first.


        L               Toggle between instrument and SpFX tables.

                        Enters the other table. If you type it outside a
                        table it will enter the other table than the one
                        you edited last time. If the table window is not
                        active, it will be made active first.


        Alt Down        Change main volume byte below the current voice.

                        Beneath each voice you'll find a value which can
                        be edited with this key combination. The volumes
                        controls the main volume for that voice, and has
                        priority over volume commands in the sequence.


        Alt Up          Change logical voice byte above the voice.

                        Using "Alt-Up"  you can change the value above a
                        voice. This value is the  physical  voice number
                        attached to the voice.  Changing the values, you
                        can  completely rearrange voices - you  can even
                        make the same voice appear at several places! It
                        may come in handy when some voices has something
                        in common, like chords or double-voice drums.


        Ctrl            Fast forward while in FollowPlay mode.

                        Only works when in  FollowPlay mode. You  cannot
                        use fast forward when playing with F1.


        Alt 1-9         Toggles voices 1-9 ON or OFF.

                        Note that the logical voice numbers above voices
                        goes dark grey when a voice is OFF.


        Alt Tab         Turn all voices OFF except the edited voice.


        ,               Turn all voices ON.


        .               Turn all voices OFF.


        -               Toggle current voice ON or OFF.


        Q2W3ER5...      Play in note column or instrument/SpFX tables.

                        Use these keys to play with the instrument or to
                        type notes in the right column of a sequence. As
                        you type a key the instrument last edited in the
                        main instrument table will play. Use the Ctrl-Up
                        and Ctrl-Down keys to change the octave.


        Spacebar        Erase sequence command or a REST in note column.

                        In the sequence itself you can erase commands or
                        notes by tapping space on them.  SPACE on a note
                        enters a REST (---) event.


        X/C/V           Put a HOLD (+++) in the note column.

                        All 3 keys have the  exact same  meaning. I made
                        this to make it easier  for you to edit blindly.
                        As the key is pressed, a HOLD (+++) appears.


        Z               HOLD to the previous note, REST to the next.

                        A very useful command that should be used  when-
                        ever possible instead of SPACE  and X/C/V. Press
                        it to put HOLD (+++) up towards the note and put
                        REST (---) down towards the next one. It ignores
                        the presence  of old HOLD and REST. Also, it may
                        be pressed in  the command column - which is not
                        possible with the other HOLD/REST keys.


        «               Toggle tienote ON or OFF.

                        On my keyboard it is the key just below  the ESC
                        and above the TAB key. When pressed  on an event
                        in a sequence, it toggles the note white/yellow.
                        When white, the note is changed in the music but
                        the effects of the instrument is NOT restarted.


        Enter           Jumps between track editing or sequence editing.

                        Also used to edit names in the instrument table.

                        This is probably the most used key when  editing
                        notes as it jumps in and out of track values. In
                        the instrument table you can edit the name of an
                        instrument  with this key. This name may contain
                        up to 16 characters.


        Tab             Jump to the right voice.

        Ctrl Tab        Jump to the left voice.

                        Use the above keys  to switch between voices. As
                        you enter a new voice the voice is "blown up" to
                        show the entire voice (track, commands & notes).
                        The other voices  will be shrinked, so that only
                        the notes can be seen - the most essential part!
                        You can spot the beginning  and end of sequences
                        by observing the ">   <" signs around the notes.


        Q               Enter the next unused sequence in the track.

                        Another useful function. When editing a song and
                        deleting/inserting  sequences, you  may at times
                        forget which sequences  you have  used and which
                        you have trashed. By pressing the key on a track
                        number, the  editor will  automatically find the
                        first unused sequence number and enter the value
                        for you.


        ///         Cursor keys, used globally in the editor.


        Home/End        Used globally in the editor.


        Delete          Delete in track or sequence mode.


        Insert          Insert in track or sequence mode.

                        Note that you can have no  more than 5Fh  events
                        in a single sequence. If you want more than this
                        you have to split it up into two sequences.


        ESC             Exits modes, also stops the music.

                        This is also used to remove the windows with the
                        instrument and SpFX tables.


        Page Up/Down    Used globally in the editor.


        Ctrl Up         Increase the note octave.

        Ctrl Down       Decrease the note octave.

                        The above keys changes the octave available with

                        right corner  of the screen  informs you of  the
                        current value. Also Ctrl-Right may decrease.


        Ctrl Pg Up      Home to the absolute top.

        S               Toggle CPU rastertime ON or OFF.

                        The rastertime is shown as  a grey block in  the
                        outscan border. May be useful for the programmer
                        but keep in mind that the  music takes much more
                        rastertime in the editor than when packed!


        Ctrl Break      Exit to DOS.

                        You can skip the palette fade with the /P switch
                        on the commandline.

        /F              Use followplay immediately.

                        Useful when loading an EDL file from the command
                        line and you want to play it right away.


        /P              Do not fade colors when quitting.

                        If you feel annoyed having to  wait for the fade
                        to get finished, use this switch to skip it.


        /C              Convert EDL to D00 (NOT READY YET).

                        Reserved for future expansion; may in later ver-
                        sions of EdLib convert  from EDL  to D00 without
                        having to enter the editor itself. Until this is
                        implemented  you must  do it with Ctrl-F5 inside
                        the editor.


        /M              Use the MPU-401 interface.

                        If you have  an  external  synthesizer connected
                        through you MPU-401 MIDI interface  you can play
                        the AdLib instruments on it. Cursor up  and down
                        in the instrument table to choose the instrument
                        and change the octave with Ctrl-Up or Ctrl-Down.
                        Now you can play this instrument on the keyboard
                        synth, using full  polyphony and  velocity. Note
                        that aftertouch uses a  default vibrato  setting
                        which is independant of the bytes in the editor.
                        You cannot use the MIDI to record music  in this
                        version of EdLib.


        /A              Ignore AdLib detection.

                        Useful at times when the detection routine might
                        fail, even  if an  OPL2 IS present! E.g, if your
                        computer uses both a Sound Blaster and  a Gravis
                        Ultrasound at the same time. The timer detection
                        does not always work in those circumstances.
