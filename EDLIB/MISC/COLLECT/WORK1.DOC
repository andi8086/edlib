
 Jens, l‘g ikke EDLIB.REV filen med som den er. Rens den fra v1.05!! (der
 st†r lort i om PkWare's shit - ingen grund til at tage chancer.)

 N†r du skriver den seperate doc om API til player (i demo'er), s† inklud‚r
 info om det data i starten som afl‘ser noder osv til equalizers etc.
 Skriv ogs† at du ikke har noget imod at folk laver support til D00 formatet
 i deres egne commandline players.

³       At last you can lay your hands on an editor which makes full use       ³
³       of the OPL2 AdLib capabilities of your AdLib card or compatibles       ³
³       such as the entire Sound Blaster series! The editor you now have       ³
³       in your possession was in fact developed mainly in 1992-1993. In       ³
³       1993 I enhanced it furthermore, this time mostly cosmetical only       ³
³       but also a few userfriendly additions such as a filesystem which       ³
³       packs the work tune on your harddisk to save space. Since 1993 I       ³
³       hardly touched it - however, it was used a lot in games projects       ³
³       such as LollyPop from Brain Bug (released by Rainbow Arts).            ³
³                                                                              ³
³       Actually it was my intention to keep the editor for ourselves in       ³
³       order to support AdLib in games.  However, since the development       ³
³       of the editor I have experienced a generel hostility towards the       ³
³       old AdLib standard. People begun to actually hate FM sounds. The       ³
³       arrival of GUS and AWE 32 made wavetable techniques very popular       ³
³       and indeed it sounds very good, but there are some things in the       ³
³       old FM standard that is unique. You can't fiddle with samples in       ³
³       the same way  as you can with FM. I personally never quite liked       ³
³       sampling, I find it downright boring. With a FM chip it  is like       ³
³       on a C64; you have a few parameters and everything you do has to       ³
³       be done within these parameters. These boundaries makes it funny       ³
³       to make music, to see how far you can actually push AdLib. To do       ³
³       sounds on FM requires expertice but if you're good at it, almost       ³
³       any instrument can be reproduced properly, except perhaps drums.       ³
³                                                                              ³
³       This is the reason why I decided to release my editor. It uses a       ³
³       system very similar to the ordinary tracker system, but has been       ³
³       enhanced with individual sequences for each track. Each sequence       ³
³       can  even vary in size. Because  of the natural way of designing       ³
³       my system, I  find it vastly  superior to the tracker system. It       ³
³       uses  much less memory and allows each sequence to be transposed       ³
³       individually. This is the exact same system as I used on the C64       ³
³       editor which was heavily used in that scene.                           ³
³                                                                              ³
³       Lovers of the old Commodore 64 with the editing system used here       ³
³       should be able to use the editor right away. Just tap ALT-F1 and       ³
³       a list of keys will appear. :)                                         ³
³                                                                              ³
³       As an extra bonus I have included a player with the instructions       ³
³       on how to use the finished music in your own programs!                 ³
³                                                                              ³

³       The editor requires a PC with 80x50 text screen capabilities and       ³
³       an AdLib card or  compatible. Anything  that is equipped with an       ³
³       OPL2 chip or better. I wouldn't recommend using the SBOS program       ³
³       for the GUS however - it doesn't emulate FM sounds 100% correct.       ³
³                                                                              ³
³       Enhanced keyboard is optional - F11 and F12 is used but has been       ³
³       duplicated elsewhere to support all keyboards.                         ³
³                                                                              ³
³       If you have a MPU-401 interface (or compatible) you can use your       ³
³       synthesizer to play with AdLib instruments through MIDI.               ³

³       The archive contains both the  editor and loads of demo songs to       ³
³       demonstrate the editor. Below is just some of the things you can       ³
³       do with the editor...                                                  ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Edit and play 9 voices of AdLib while viewing and editing 1024       ³
³         instruments complete with a name for each instrument.                ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Save all music and instruments in a work file of approximately       ³
³         3 to 9 Kb size. These files will have the extension "EDL".           ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Pack the music to a compressed format (around 1 - 6 Kb), which       ³
³         is directly playable in your own programs. Extension is "D00".       ³
³         Packed music also uses much less processor time.                     ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Edit song name and composer name. This information also exists       ³
³         in the compressed D00 format.                                        ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Because EDL and D00 is not compatible, you can be sure the D00       ³
³         cannot be ripped and edited. The editor does not load D00. You       ³
³         may find this bad, but I actually see this as an advantage. Do       ³
³         you like people to mess around in your source tune? ;)               ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - All AdLib parameters editable, with extra enhancements such as       ³
³         hard restart, arpeggio, modulation programs and finetune.            ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Both tune speed and  timer IRQ speed may be edited. The normal       ³
³         tune speed uses a floating point  system to access more speeds       ³
³         with a smaller granularity than normally possible.                   ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Use "+++" to hold a note in sequences and "---" to release it.       ³
³         This makes it easier to control the ADSR of an instrument.           ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Play with instruments  using "QWERT..." - and if your keyboard       ³
³         is connected via a  MPU-401 compatible MIDI interface, you can       ³
³         even play  the AdLib instruments on it, complete with velocity       ³
³         and aftertouch. And polyphonic too of course. I've tested this       ³
³         on both the original  MPU-401 and the Sound Blaster 16. I only
³         use the UART mode on the interface.
³
³       - Very flexible track and sequence system taking less memory and
³         is much more efficient than the standard tracker system. Every
³         sequence is piled on top of each other to show you exactly how
³         the music is played.
³
³       - Unique tienote command makes it possible to play notes without
³         restarting the effects set for the instruments.
³
³       - Full delete, insert, copy and other similar editing facilities
³         available in both tracks and sequences.
³
³       - Use "FollowPlay" to see the music scroll as it is being played
³         at the same time. You may even use fast forward in this mode.
