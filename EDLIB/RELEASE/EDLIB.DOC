³       At last you can lay your hands on an editor which makes full use       ³
³       of the OPL2 AdLib capabilities of your AdLib card or compatibles       ³
³       such as the entire Sound Blaster series! The editor you now have       ³
³       in your possession was in fact developed mainly in 1992-1993. In       ³
³       1993 I enhanced it furthermore, this time mostly cosmetical only       ³
³       but also a few userfriendly additions such as a filesystem which       ³
³       packs the work tune on your harddisk to save space. Since 1993 I       ³
³       hardly touched it - however, it was used a lot in games projects       ³
³       such as LollyPop from Brain Bug (released by Rainbow Arts).            ³
³                                                                              ³
³       Actually it was my intention to keep the editor for ourselves in       ³
³       order to support AdLib in games.  However, since the development       ³
³       of the editor I have experienced a generel hostility towards the       ³
³       old AdLib standard. People begun to actually hate FM sounds. The       ³
³       arrival of GUS and AWE 32 made wavetable techniques very popular       ³
³       and indeed it sounds very good, but there are some things in the       ³
³       old FM standard that is unique. You can't fiddle with samples in       ³
³       the same way  as you can with FM. I personally never quite liked       ³
³       sampling, I find it downright boring. With a FM chip it  is like       ³
³       on a C64; you have a few parameters and everything you do has to       ³
³       be done within these parameters. These boundaries makes it funny       ³
³       to make music, to see how far you can actually push AdLib. To do       ³
³       sounds on FM requires expertice but if you're good at it, almost       ³
³       any instrument can be reproduced properly, except perhaps drums.       ³
³                                                                              ³
³       This is the reason why I decided to release my editor. It uses a       ³
³       system very similar to the ordinary tracker system, but has been       ³
³       enhanced with individual sequences for each track. Each sequence       ³
³       can  even vary in size. Because  of the natural way of designing       ³
³       my system, I  find it vastly  superior to the tracker system. It       ³
³       uses  much less memory and allows each sequence to be transposed       ³
³       individually. This is the exact same system as I used on the C64       ³
³       editor which was heavily used in that scene.                           ³
³                                                                              ³
³       Freaks from the good old C-64 with the editing system used there       ³
³       should be able to use the editor right away. Just tap ALT-F1 and       ³
³       a list of keys will appear. :)                                         ³
³                                                                              ³
³       As an extra bonus I have included a player with the instructions       ³
³       on how to use the finished music in your own programs! Please go       ³
³       to the "USE" directory and read the DOC file there for some more       ³

³       The archive contains both the  editor and loads of demo songs to       ³
³       demonstrate the editor. Below is just some of the things you can       ³
³       do with the editor...                                                  ³
³                                                                              ³

³       - Edit and play 9 voices of AdLib while viewing and editing 1024       ³
³         instruments complete with a name for each instrument.                ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Save all music and instruments in a work file of approximately       ³
³         3 to 9 Kb size. These files will have the extension "EDL".           ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Pack the music to a compressed format (around 1 - 6 Kb), which       ³
³         is directly playable in your own programs. Extension is "D00".       ³
³         Packed music also uses much less processor time.                     ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Edit song name and composer name. This information also exists       ³
³         in the compressed D00 format.                                        ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Because EDL and D00 is not compatible, you can be sure the D00       ³
³         cannot be ripped and edited. The editor does not load D00. You       ³
³         may find this bad, but I actually see this as an advantage. Do       ³
³         you like people to mess around in your source tune? ;)               ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - All AdLib parameters editable, with extra enhancements such as       ³
³         hard restart, arpeggio, modulation programs and finetune.            ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Both tune speed and  timer IRQ speed may be edited. The normal       ³
³         tune speed uses a floating point  system to access more speeds       ³
³         with a smaller granularity than normally possible.                   ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Use "+++" to hold a note in sequences and "---" to release it.       ³
³         This makes it easier to control the ADSR of an instrument.           ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Play with instruments  using "QWERT..." - and if your keyboard       ³
³         is connected via a  MPU-401 compatible MIDI interface, you can       ³
³         even play  the AdLib instruments on it, complete with velocity       ³
³         and aftertouch. And polyphonic too of course. I've tested this       ³
³         on both the original  MPU-401 and the Sound Blaster 16. I only       ³
³         use the UART mode on the interface.                                  ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Very flexible track and sequence system taking less memory and       ³
³         is much more efficient than the standard tracker system. Every       ³
³         sequence is piled on top of each other to show you exactly how       ³
³         the music is played.                                                 ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Unique tienote command makes it possible to play notes without       ³
³         restarting the effects set for the instruments.                      ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Full delete, insert, copy and other similar editing facilities       ³
³         available in both tracks and sequences.                              ³
³                                                                              ³
³       - Use "FollowPlay" to see the music scroll as it is being played       ³
³         at the same time. You may even use fast forward in this mode.        ³
³                                                                              ³

³       The editor requires a PC with 80x50 text screen capabilities and       ³
³       an AdLib card or  compatible. Anything  that is equipped with an       ³
³       OPL2 chip or better. I wouldn't recommend using the SBOS program       ³
³       for the GUS however - it doesn't emulate FM sounds 100% correct.       ³
³                                                                              ³

³       I have included a file named "THE_EGA.CPI" which  you can use in       ³
³       your AUTOEXEC.BAT instead of the old "EGA.CPI" file. It contains       ³
³       a new 80x25 character set by Claus Marn›e (Banshee/Bonzai) and a       ³
³       great new 80x50 character set by Niels Krogh Mortensen (Who made       ³
³       the original Hugo TV character for SilverRock Productions). When       ³
³       using EdLib the editor will look much better with this installed       ³
³       in your AUTOEXEC.BAT. The editor redefines a few characters, but       ³
³       still uses  the rest of the character set in DOS. If you live in       ³
³       Denmark as I do, these lines will do the trick:                        ³
³                                                                              ³

³       Remember to copy the file in USE/DOS into your DOS directory and       ³
³       you are off running with the new character set. Look in your DOS       ³
³       manual for other contry codes specific for your country.               ³

³       In the following chapters I will try to  describe all the things       ³
³       that you really need  to know. I will not go  into detail on how       ³
³       to make music, enter notes and build up a tune  from scratch - I       ³
³       leave that up to you to  figure that out. If you have previously       ³
³       been using trackers, you should have no trouble using my editor.       ³
³                                                                              ³
³       During these chapters  I will discuss  the commands available in       ³
³       the  tracks and  sequences, the instrument and SpFX tables, keys       ³
³       available  in the entire editor - and the command line switches.       ³
³       Other things global to the editor will be discussed here.              ³
³                                                                              ³
³       While editing tracks, sequences and tables  you can benefit from       ³
³       the help window in the lower left corner of the screen. I advise       ³
³       you to read this DOC at least once, however.                           ³
³                                                                              ³
³       All the three-letter box values in the lower right corner of the       ³
³       screen will be discussed in the section over keys. The space you       ³
³       see above the "Oc?" box (octave) will be ticked  whenever a tune       ³
³       has been modified without saving. This way, you can always check       ³
³       if it is time to save your tune. However, this version  of EdLib       ³
³       does not check the box if you only alter the tables. This is due       ³
³       to technical reasons; the table  routines have  been placed in a       ³
³       seperate module - and frankly, I was too lazy to fix it! ;)            ³
³                                                                              ³
³       The version v04.01 of the player is displayed in the upper right       ³
³       corner of the screen. In the subdirectory "PLAYER" you will find       ³
³       the file "PLAYER.BIN" which is the actual player. It is possible       ³
³       that later  versions of the editor only  requires this player to       ³
³       be replaced - in case of player updates only. In the upper right       ³
³       corner  you will also find a  tune clock. Useful if you  want to       ³
³       measure the exact length of the song.                                  ³
³                                                                              ³
³       When using the load/save requester, all EDL files will be placed       ³
³       in a subdirectory called "SONGS". Later I may enhance the editor       ³
³       with diretories and path input, but until then you must save and       ³
³       load all your songs in this directory. Note that when saving the       ³
³       song you can type the new name at the input prompt in the bottom       ³
³       of the requester. Songs with an EDL extension will be compressed       ³
³       to save disk space.                                                    ³
³                                                                              ³
³       It is possible to predefine the contents of all sequences in the       ³
³       editor before actually  using  them. Edit sequence #000 until it       ³
³       has the appearance you want all sequences to have and then press       ³
³       Shift-F1 to  fill all  other sequences with it.  Because this is       ³
³       really happens when the song is cleared; sequence #000 is copied       ³
³       into all the other sequences!                                          ³
³                                                                              ³

³                       does NOT make use of the internal OPL2 vibrato.        ³

³       The parameters in both carrier and modulator uses the exact same       ³
³       parameters, only the "modulator" part usually changes the  color       ³
³       of the sound while the "carrier" changes the volume and pitch. I       ³
³       said "usually", because this depends on the way the operators is       ³
³       connected. More about this later.                                      ³

³       NOTE: It is wise to leave instrument #0000 at the values defined       ³
³       in the example above since this instrument is in fact  used when       ³
³       executing a CUT command (6000 in the command column).                  ³
³                                                                              ³
³       The carrier and modulator parameters will be send to the OPL2 FM       ³
³       chip directly, as they are hardware based. Lets  have a  look at       ³
³       the parameters individually.                                           ³
³                                                                              ³
³                                                                              ³
³       FFFF    This parameter controls the ADSR of the instrument. Some       ³
³               of you already knows what this  means. If you  come from       ³
³               the Commodore 64  and have been fiddling with ADSR here,       ³
³               all you have to know is that is behaves upside-down - it       ³
³               takes FF02 instead of 00FE! Otherwise it is very simple.       ³
³               Each nibble ("F", a halfbyte), takes a parameter from 0h       ³
³               to Fh, to define four parameters named the Attack, Decay       ³
³               Sustain and Release. The attack defines the speed of the       ³
³               volume to reach maximum level, Fh is fastest. As soon as       ³
³               this level has been reached, the Decay value defines the       ³
³               speed of the  volume to reach  the Sustain level. Again,       ³
³               Fh is fastest. Sustain is a pseudo-volume level (volume)       ³
³               where 0 is loudest. Release again  defines the  speed of       ³
³               the volume to go from the Sustain level  to silence. All       ³
³               in all, a diagram like this  can be drawn  to illustrate       ³
³               the ADSR envelope:                                             ³

³               In the modulator, the ADSR works is a similar way - only       ³
³               it affects the modulation instead of the volume.  Use it       ³
³               to give "life" to the instrument.                              ³

³       3F      This parameter is split into bit 0-5 for the main volume       ³
³               (level) and bit 6-7 for keyboard scaled level (KSL). The       ³
³               level is 00h-3Fh, where 00h is loudest. Add  40h, 80h or       ³
³               C0h for three rates of KSL. The KSL defines how much the       ³
³               volume decreases  in volume as the notes climbs upwards.       ³
³               In other words, the higher the note, the lower the level       ³
³               of the note. This feature is not used very often.              ³
³                                                                              ³
³               In the modulator part, the level affects the  modulation       ³
³               instead of the volume. 00h is full modulation (100%).          ³
³                                                                              ³

³       20      This is a multiple purpose register of the FM chip. Bits       ³
³               0-3 defines the multiplier, which  works  like an octave       ³
³               parameter only it steps in a rather absurd way. With it,       ³
³               you can change the pitch without  editing the music - to       ³
³               some degree! Bit 4 (add 10h)  sets the KSR - which means       ³
³               keyboard scaled rate. It works like KSL only it  affects       ³
³               the speed of which the ADSR is processed. The higher the       ³
³               note, the faster the ADSR. Bit 5 (add 20h) selects  ADSR       ³
³               or only ADR. Normally, you would set this to 1 (ADSR) or       ³
³               the HOLD/REST in sequences will be ignored;  notes  will       ³
³               release as soon as the note has been triggered. This may       ³
³               come in handy at times though. Bit 6 (add 40h) enables a       ³
³               hardware vibrato. This vibrato is quite  insufficient at       ³
³               times to say the least, so I added my own vibrato to the       ³
³               sequence commands (7XYY). Last, bit 7 (add 80h)  enables       ³
³               the hardware tremolo. Tremolo vibrates the level - think       ³
³               of it as the "Elvis Costello" bit! ;)                          ³

³       00      Only values  from 00 to 03  is used here (bits 0-1). All       ³
³               other bits is ignored. This value  defines the  waveform       ³
³               of the operator. If you come from the  Commodore 64 with       ³
³               its marvellous SID-chip, you will be disappointed to see       ³
³               what waveforms this chip has. They are  not  as flexible       ³
³               as the SID-chip waveforms.  00 is a sine and is loudest.       ³
³               I have also noticed that waveforms 02 and 03 seems to be       ³
³               one octave higher than 00 and 01.  I will try my best to       ³
³               draw the waveforms now using the terrible ASCII chars.         ³

³               lator operator will behave exactly as the  carrier. This       ³
³               is great for organ sounds! Bits 1-3 defines the feedback       ³

³       The above example uses instrument #0001 to produce a 0-3-7 chord       ³
³       using arpeggio. The duration bytes  are all 00, meaning that the       ³
³       arpeggio  will run at the fastest possible speed.  No modulation       ³
³       adding is involved. Notice how the pointers makes the three sets       ³
³       spin around in an endless loop! Use B000 in  the sequence to try       ³
