³       6000            Cut/Stop the voice instantly. Instrument #000 in
                        the instrument table is used to cut the voice.

        7XYY            Vibrato - X defines the  speed (0-F), and YY the
                        depth (00-FF) of the vibrato effect. This effect
                        does NOT make use of the internal OPL2 vibrato.

        90XX            New level - XX defines the  level (00-3F), where
                        3F is silent. Level is another word for volume.

        BXXX            Pointer to SpFX table. The SpFX table is the one
                        you can access  with the  "K" key. Refer to this
                        table for  more information. This  command works
                        like an instrument, thus it overrides a CXXX. It
                        may range from 000-7FF.

        CXXX            Instrument. XXX may range from 000 to 3FF. It is
                        good practise to  leave #000  as a "no sound" as
                        this instrument is in fact  used when typing the
                        cut command (6000). The table may  be entered by
                        pressing  the "M" key. Refer  to this  table for
                        more information.

        DXXX            Slide up. XXX defines the speed of sliding.

        EXXX            Slide down. XXX defines the speed of sliding. It
                        does not  automatically "tie unto" the next note
                        like in other music  players. You must "tie" the
                        next note yourself with the «-key and adjust the
                        speed of sliding  until  it is perfect. This may
                        sound awkward at first, but this way  of sliding
                        is much more flexible.


        TRACK COMMANDS
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

        The track consists of a DWORD in the editor, but the table is in
        fact interpreted word for word internally.


        8XYY????        The 8000 command defines  the transposition of a
                        sequence. X is the  direction, 0=Up.  YY defines
                        the number of halftones to transpose. A value of
                        810C transposes the sequence down one octave but
                        does not change  the on-screen appearance of the
                        notes in the  sequence. Using the  transposition
                        feature  properly, you can  save a LOT of  space
                        compared to the average tracker system! The word
                        ???? defines the sequence number itself.

        FFFFXXXX        When this DWORD  is met,  the voice will restart
                        at the position defined in XXXX. It is important
                        to know that it counts in WORD steps. This means
                        that if you have ten  sequences in a row  with a
                        FFFFXXXX in the end, use FFFF0006 to wrap to the
                        fourth sequence - like this:

                                80000001      0 - 1      1st...

                                80000003      2 - 3      2nd...

                                80000001      4 - 5      3rd...

                             ³

                             ³

                             ³
                             ³  80070005                 8th...
                             ³
                             ³  80000002                 9th...
                             ³
                             ³  80000006                 10th...
                             ³
                             ÀÄ FFFF0006                 Wrap...

                        The player  interpretes the  wraps independantly
                        from voice to voice. This means that neither the
                        wrap position nor the length of tracks has to be
                        aligned.

        FFFE????        This command stops the voice  entirely. The ????
                        WORD will be ignored. Very useful for jingles!
