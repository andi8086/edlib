Source Codes for JCH's EdLib Editor v1.05a
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This package contains the old assembler source codes for the EdLib editor that
was created in the 90's to edit and play AdLib music. The source codes have not
been released in public before 2019.

The source codes are presented to you "as is" and will not be explained in this
document. Back in the 90's they were compiled with Borland Turbo Assembler and
naturally required an AdLib and/or a Sound Blaster sound card. You can use an
emulator such as DOSBox (http://dosbox.sourceforge.net) to play the executable
files in it, but you're going to have to find the programming tools yourself if
you plan on compiling them again. I imagine that the source codes would serve
a better purpose as information for converting to plugins or players that will
be played by the software of today.

NOTE: If you want to try and assemble everything, you may also have to grab the
archive with the old library source codes. It can be downloaded here:

One last thing. I haven't been coding in assembler for many years now - so if
you have any questions regarding the inner workings of this editor, I probably
can't help out much today. You're pretty much on your own. Good luck!
