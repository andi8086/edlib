 How to use Player v04.00 ............................ by Jens-Christian Huus 
쳐컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴캑
                                                                              
                                                                              
       INTRODUCTION                                                           
       컴컴컴컴컴컴                                                           
                                                                              
       So you have finally managed to fumble you way  around the editor       
       and now you want to use the music in your demo or other piece of       
       programming not earning you any money (Because THAT's the deal)!       
        All right, in this directory you will find the OBJ player needed
        to link onto your own program. This DOC  will tell you about the
        functions and variables in the player plus the file formats.

        After having done your tune in the editor - saving the source to
        disk with Shift-F12 or Ctrl-F4 - you must convert it to a format
        with the ".D00" extension. Do this by  pressing Ctrl-F5 while in
        the editor. The music  will be packed to a fully playable format
        which takes up little memory (typically 2-5 Kb). Now you can use
        this file together with "MPLAYER.OBJ" in this directory.

        NOTE: You cannot load ".D00" files into EdLib. Make sure you DID
        save that masterpiece with Shift-F12 or Ctrl-F4 before packing!


        THE TEST PROGRAM
        컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

        Before describing the functions in the player, have a look at my
        example file "TEST.ASM" to see how I use the "STR_WISE.D00" file
        by Drax. The source was assembled using Turbo Assembler v4.0 and
        linked using Turbo Link v6.00, both from Borland. You can use my
        makefile "-" to accomplish this, but check it out first - I have
        used the 4DOS command "keystack 13" to  skip the annoying "Press
        any key to continue" message before reentering my source editor.
        I have also  used a "mode co80,50" to switch into 50 lines mode,
        a mode I use a lot when programming.

        The file "GLOBALS.INC" is included in the source. This file con-
        tains most of the variables in  the player, but in the TEST file
        I only use the "GLOBAL PLAYER:FAR" line to call the player. Some
        of the other  variables will be discussed  later, as they can be
        used to make scopes or the like in your own programs.

        The execution of the "TEST.ASM" file is simple - first it checks
        if an OPL2 chip is present using a function in the player. If it
        isn't, an error is printed and the program is aborted. Otherwise
        the ".D00" is loaded, the player initialized and started. I have
        used a standard timer interrupt routine to call the AdLib player
        as many times as it was used in the  editor (this information is
        saved into the ".D00" file). The source  code has been commented
        all the way, so I guess I don't have to say more than that.


        PLAYER FUNCTIONS
        컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

        Use the "CALL PLAYER" label prepared by "GLOBAL PLAYER:FAR" with
        registers prepared to access all player functions. The player is
        from my old school, so no registers are pushed I'm afraid. Do it
        yourself. Here is a list of the functions currently available in
        this version of the player.


        MAIN RESET      AH      00h
                        BX:CX   Segment:offset of ".D00" data #1
                        ES:DI   Segment:offset of ".D00" data #2

        Initializes the soundcard, clears variables and resets constants
        as well as informing the player of the location of the tune. The
        ES:DI pair is normally  not of any interest  to you. It was used
        in games  such as "Lollypop" to split up musics and SFX into two
        parts; one for general stuff and one for level-specific stuff.


        RESET           AH      01h

        Use this function whenever you want to stop the player. Eg, when
        quitting to DOS and stuff like that. Clears all variables too.


        START           AH      02h
                        BX      Tune number (Usually 0000h)

        Actually starts the tune. In BX more than one piece of music can
        be triggered, something that was useful in games. However, EdLib
        does not know how to pack more than one tune at this moment - so
        I guess you have to tap a 0000h there, no matter what.


        PLAY            AH      03h

        This is the function that goes into the timer interrupt or maybe
        the vertical retrace. Whatever. Just as long as you update it as
        many times as  the 8th byte  in the ".D00" file is set to. EdLib
        sets this byte to 70 (46h) as default.


        TOGGLE          AH      04h
                        BX      Tune number (Usually 0000h)

        Pauses the music instantly. This feature is very useful in games
        when the pause button is pressed. Calling it once more continues
        the music to the best of its abilities; notes falling in quickly
        makes the continuation faultless. But if the notes were long...


        MAINVOL         AH      05h
                        BL      Main volume for part one
                        BH      Main volume for part two
                        CL      Dividing line

        This main volume is a little more complicated than a normal main
        volume routine. Using values of 00h-3Fh  in BL or/and BH you can
        split the main volume up into certain voice parts. Knowing  that
        AdLib has 9 voices, a value of 04h in CL splits up the two reg's
        into  voices 0-3 and 4-8. In  games such  as "Lollypop" this was
        very useful when seperating main volumes for music or SFX, since
        the SFX used voices 0-3 and the music voices 4-8. NOTE: AdLib is
        upside down concerning level (volume) values; use 3Fh as silent.


        SCAN            AH      06h

                        CF=0    If the card was detected

        Tries to detect the OPL2 chip (standard AdLib FM chip) using the
        AdLib timer method. If it fails, the carry is set. NOTE: In some
        occasions the detection will fail if there is both a GUS (Gravis
        Ultrasound) and an OPL2 based soundcard in the computer at once.
        It is recommended that you make it possible to override it. Make
        a switch on the commandline or something like that.


        BREAK/CONTINUE  AH      07h
                        BL=0    Break, otherwise (if BL<>0) continue

        This is not a function I can imagine you're ever going to use. I
        made it to make it possible to  break the tune, "remember" where
        it came and start another tune (going into a sublevel). When the
        sublevel was over, this function would then continue on the song
        it "remembered". Since EdLib does not allow more  than one piece
        of music in a ".D00" file, it is not of much use to you! :(


        REQUEST         AH      08h
                        BX      Tune number (Usually 0000h)

                        CF=1    If it is still running

        Simply checks if a tune or SFX ends. Needless to say it requires
        that you use the "FFFExxxx" endmarks in all of the tracks! It is
        not of much use to you, but in games it was worth every penny.


        PLAYER HEADER VARIABLES
        컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

        From offset 0000h in the player I have put certain constants and
        variables at places that will stay the same in every player that
        may be developed for EdLib. These may come in handy if  creating
        some sort of ".D00" shell which loads the player.


        Offset          Description
        컴컴컴          컴컴컴컴컴

        0000h-0002h     JMP to all functions which ends with RETF

        0003h-0008h     Detection bytes ('JCH',26h,02h,66h)

        0009h-000ah     Current card player version (0400h)

        000bh           Indicates normal OPL2 player (00h)

        000ch           Number of voices supported (09h)

        000dh-002ch     32 bytes card name ('AdLib     ')

        002dh-002eh     Pointer to "Inst" variables

        002fh           Indicates that "Inst" is WORD-based (01h)

        0030h-0031h     Pointer to "Dur" variables

        0032h           Indicates that "Dur" is WORD-based (01h)

        0033h-0034h     Pointer to "SeqPoi" variables

        0035h           Indicates that "SeqPoi" is WORD-based (01h)

        0036h-0037h     Pointer to "TrackPoi" variables

        0038h           Indicates that "TrackPoi" is WORD-based (01h)

        0039h-003ah     Pointer to "Freq" variables

        003bh           Indicates that "Freq" is WORD-based (01h)

        003ch-003dh     Pointer to "Spedr" variables

        003eh           Indicates that "Spedr" is BYTE-based (00h)

        003fh-0040h     Pointer to "Gate" variables

        0041h           Indicates that "Gate" is BYTE-based (00h)

        0042h-0043h     Pointer to "Nog" variables

        0044h           Indicates that "Nog" is BYTE-based (00h)

        0045h-0046h     Pointer to "Note" variables

        0047h           Indicates that "Note" is BYTE-based (00h)

        0048h-0067h     32 bytes reserved for future expansion

        0068h-0070h     ON/OFF flags for all 9 voices (00h=Off)

        0071h-????h     Copyright string, and rest of player


        Some notes about the information above may be necessary.

        The JMP at position 0000h makes it  possible to turn  the player
        into a BIN-file and just call the player from offset 0000h.

        You may wonder about the detection bytes. The 'JCH' is of course
        my initials. 26h,02h,66h is my birthdate; 26th of february 1966.

        Offset 000bh-002ch was made to identify this player from players
        written for other soundcards. I soon burried this idea.

        All the variables pointers each points to nine bytes or words in
        which you may find valuable information for shell programs. Here
        is a deeper explanation of these variables...


        "Inst"          9 WORDS         Current instrument played

        "Dur"           9 WORDS         Realtime note duration counters

        "SeqPoi"        9 WORDS         Realtime sequence position

        "TrackPoi"      9 WORDS         Realtime track position

        "Freq"          9 WORDS         Actual raw frequency played

        "Spedr"         9 BYTES         Current speed of the tune

        "Gate"          9 BYTES         Key ON/OFF flags (+++/---)

        "Nog"           9 BYTES         Tienote indicator flags

        "Note"          9 BYTES         Current note including transp.


        Note that the variables offered in the header of the player will
        also be available though the "GlOBALS.INC" file when linking. It
        is recommended that you fetch the variables that way if you only
        plan on LINKING with the player.

        There are more variables in the "GLOBALS.INC" file, but since it
        is beyond the scope of this DOC to describe them I will leave it
        up to you if you want to figure them all out! ;)


        THE ".D00" FORMAT
        컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

        Here comes an extensive description of the ".D00" files. With it
        you can make support for ".D00" files in your commandline player
        if you're working on such a program.


        Offset          Description
        컴컴컴          컴컴컴컴컴

        0000h-0005h     Detection bytes ('JCH',26h,02h,66h)

        0006h           Block type (00h for music data)

        0007h           Player version required (Usually 04h)

        0008h           Timer speed for the block (Usually 46h)

        0009h           Number of music and SFX (Usually 01h)

        000ah           Soundcard (Usually 00h for AdLib)

        000bh-002ah     32 bytes name of the music

        002bh-004ah     32 bytes name of composer

        004bh-006ah     32 bytes reserved for future expansion

        006bh-006ch     Pointer to "Tpoin" tables

        006dh-006eh     Pointer to "SeqPointer" tables

        006fh-0070h     Pointer to "Instrument" tables

        0071h-0072h     Pointer to "DataInfo" text

        0073h-0074h     Pointer to "Special" tables (SpFX)

        0075h           Endmark (FFFFh)


        Again, some notes about the information above may be necessary.

        Offset 0006h is always 00h. It was made to tell music data apart
        from sample data. EdLib of course always sets this to 00h.

        Some years ago I spread some old ".D00" music files which I made
        in old AdLib players (v02.00 and below). Some of  this music may
        not sound too good in player v04.00. Check if this byte contains
        04h. If it doesn't, you better avoid loading it.

        When using the AdLib player you should always check offset 0008h
        to see how many times a second the player should be called.

        EdLib always sets offset 0009h to 01h. You cannot make more than
        one piece of music at a time in the editor.

        Offset 000ah is always set to 00h in EdLib. If you encounter any
        strange ".D00" files containing any other value you better avoid
        loading it.

        Even though the ".D00" format allows 32 bytes for both the music
        name and the composer name, EdLib only accepts 20 characters.

        The pointers to various tables is really  not of any interest to
        you, except "DataInfo" which in old songs occasionally contained
        additional text about the song. Tables  such as "Instrument" may
        be useful to know in case you want to edit the ".D00" file! ;)


        LAST WORDS
        컴컴컴컴컴

        You may wonder why it takes so much  time to play a pesky little
        AdLib tune. After all, the player is not mixing like MOD players
        so what the hell is going on here? Bad programming? No!! It is a
        sad fact but true nonetheless; When outputting a value to the FM
        chip like OPL2 I must wait 6 "IN" instructions after the reg has
        been output, and 35 (!) "IN" instructions after the value itself
        has been sent. If I try to decrease the  number of instructions,
        some computers begins to play wrong; notes start falling out and
        play false. There ARE alternatives to using the "IN" method, one
        of the  best is to use the "timer tick"  method. But there is an
        even better method.

        One of my friends who is working on an editor for OPL3 (the four
        operator chip on SB Pro II and SB 16 to mention a few) found out
        that this chip has been optimized so much, that instead of 6 and
        35 "IN's" it only requires 1 and 0 "IN's" !! I tried it on quite
        a lot of computers, it actually works! If the OPL3 exists it may
        play well in OPL2 mode with  a very small CPU usage. In fact, it
        takes as little time as a native GUS player! :)

        Only one problem arises however. I have not made a detection for
        the OPL3 chip. I haven't  even  tried to, but if I find a way to
        do it, I may very well implement it in the next player update.
